            The Koki app provides an easy way for users to create and automate
            matching and conversation generation for an organization (company,
            class, not-for-profit, etc.)

          <h2>Koki: How to setup a matching</h2>
          <p>An end-to- matching setup can be the following steps:</p>
          <h3>Step 1: Uploading a user file</h3>
          <p>
            To upload a user list, select the Users section at the left of the
            home page, on Upload at the top right (fig 2) and upload the file.
            To be accepted by the system, a user file should follow the CSV
            formatting structure . The structure of the file is given by the
            information tag just next to the upload button of the file is given
            by the tag just next to the upload button [ need shot for this]

          <h4>a. Create a matching</h4>
          <p>To create a matching:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>select the New Match section at the left of the home page,</li>
            <li>define the size of that will connect click Next (fig 3)</li>

          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li>
              select the users to match in the cycle. This sub list might from
              the comprehensive list of users in case some members temporarily
              unavailable for instance. Select all if applicable. Click Next
              (fig 4).
            </li>
            <li>
              the next screen, select preferred or forbidden tuples. Tip: select
              tuple at a time and click Forbid or Prefer button. Validated the
              selections properly displayed under the Forbidden Connections or
              Preferred Connections categories the right . Once done Click Match
              (fig 5)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>b. Create a Group</h4>
          <p>
            The organization might choose match members of a specific group A
            with those of another group B. instance, conversations between
            members of project A comity and those of the Project B can be
            desired. Note that, the
          </p>
          <p>create a group-based matching:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the New Group Match section at the left of home page,</li>
            <li>
              define the size of tuple that will connect by clicking oMatching
              Size
            </li>
            <li>
              each group, members to be matched by on grey arrow beside Users
              Group X (fig)
            </li>
            <li>
              the Users Group X selection window will then appear to allow group
              users selection. Click Add once the selection is completed (fig ).
              Repeat at least as many as the tuple size.
            </li>
            <li>
              tuples can also selected from screen (like group members
              selection) (fig 5)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>Insert figure here</figure>
          <p>
            Note that for a group-based matching, group members are selected,
            and list is static. For a more group -based selection, a tag-based
            matching might be more appropriate.
          </p>
          <h4>c. Matching by Tag</h4>
          <p>
            An organization might desire to match members based on a tag
            attached to their profile e.g. background, location, function. For
            instance, generate conversation between members of the Marketing and
            those of the department. Compared to group-based, a tag-based
            matching is it adapts to changes happening within the tagged
            populations (member and arrival) additional administrative effort.
          </p>
          <p>To create a tag-based matching:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              select the New Tag Match section at the left of the home page,
            </li>
            <li>
              define the size of tuple that will connect by clicking on Matching
              Size
            </li>
            <li>
              for each group, define or select members be matched by clicking on
              grey arrow beside Users Group X (fig)
            </li>
            <li>
              the Users Group X selection window then appear to allow group
              users selection. Click Add once the selection is completed (fig ).
              Repeat at least as many groups as the size.
            </li>
            <li>
              forbidden tuples also be selected from screen (like selection)
              (fig 6)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>Insert figure here</figure>
          <h3>Step 3: Validating/Modifying Matches</h3>
          <p>
            2 matching is completed, tuples can be validated, and quick edits
            can necessary.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              From the Matching Results screen, perform a sanity over the tuples
              generated
            </li>
            <li>
              If necessary, the tuples that need to be adjusted (there should be
              minimum 2 tuples selected)
            </li>
            <li>
              Select the circle button with a white at top right of screen, then
              click the circled arrow icon to reshuffle the users into different
              tuples. (fig)
